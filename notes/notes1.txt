-> why css always import in head ?
-- It is recommended because when you have the CSS declared before <body> starts, your styles has actually loaded already. So very quickly users see something appear on their screen (e.g. background colors). If not, users see blank screen for some time before the CSS reaches the user.

     it is because servers don't fetch code directly from local (first we push to git) then they get it from there we need to push 100% package.lock
---- it maintains the integrity that the same package version is used on production also
