1. what is pollyfills ?
let's you have code which not works on older version then there is pollyfills code which will work in a same way but for older version  and this is done by babel automatically itself. babel is just a package which takes new code and spit older code.

2. browserList : "last 2 chrome versions" that means it will definitely work on last two versions of chrome.
*create-react-app uses webPack with babel

3. you can assume npm run as npx   "npm run" when you use script to run "npm run start"
4. you can use shortcut "npm start"== "npm run start"
5. .babelrc is a configuration file for babel.

6. React key concillation: when there is a many same childrens in element they give they unique key which is given in props other wise react have to do so much work

7. react keeps the track of elements using keys
8. react does things like  creating element,creating root where to inject react code and rendering.
9. object return by react.createElement is converted into html with the help of react;

10. lets say you make an react element heading and functional component Heading.
then to render element(object) ---> root.render(heading);
then to render component (function) ---> root.render(<Heading/>)
